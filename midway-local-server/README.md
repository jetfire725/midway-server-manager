# midway-server-manager
Midway server manager is an (In progress) Java application that accompanies your existing mincraft server. The App can Auto configure firewall settings, manage server properties, 
and tie static connection endpoints to servers with dynamic IP addresses. 

When complete the architecture will consist of 3 components including a local server utility, spring web app for authenticating users/relaying info to the local server, and an 
client side application for easy remote management.
